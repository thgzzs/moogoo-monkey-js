# Moogoo Monkey JS

This project is a browser-based card game. The original implementation placed all markup, style, and JavaScript in a single file. The repository now organizes the code into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files for easier maintenance.

## Files
- `index.html` – entry point for the game
- `css/style.css` – styling
- `js/script.js` – game logic

Open `index.html` in a browser to play.
